## Motivation
Many young people have to navigate early adulthood without sufficient guidance for facing practical challenges. 
These challenges may include keeping up with regular maintenance tasks associated with their house or car, remembering to pay their taxes, or simply tying a tie.


## Goals
PocketDad is a personal digital assistant that will remind the user of important tasks, such as filing taxes, cleaning the air filters in their home, or checking the tread of their tires before the winter season.
It will also provide instructions on how to carry out these tasks as well as recommendations for specific maintenance services.
PocketDad will also be able to offer general advice directed toward the specific user based on its knowledge of them.


## Usage
Currently our app consists of mockup pages with minimum utility.
