## Motivation
Many young people have to navigate early adulthood without sufficient guidance for facing practical challenges. 
These challenges may include keeping up with regular maintenance tasks associated with their house or car, remembering to pay their taxes, or simply tying a tie.


## Goals
PocketDad is a personal digital assistant that will remind the user of important tasks, such as filing taxes, cleaning the air filters in their home, or checking the tread of their tires before the winter season.
It will also provide instructions on how to carry out these tasks as well as recommendations for specific maintenance services.
PocketDad will also be able to offer general advice directed toward the specific user based on its knowledge of them.


## Usage

Phase 1: Currently our app consists of mockup pages.

| Choose Avatar | <img src="doc/chooseavatar.png" style="width: 100px"> | This page will display different Dad avatars for the user to choose from. |

| Check-in | <img src="doc/checkin-mockup.png" style="width: 100px"> | This page will inform the user of their tasks and reminders for the day. |

| Add Task | <img src="doc/add-task-mockup.png" style="width: 100px"> | This form will enable the user to add tasks to their to-do list. |

| Edit Task | <img src="doc/edit-task-mockup.png" style="width: 100px"> | The user will be able to edit existing tasks. |

| Display All Tasks | <img src="doc/tasks-mockup.png" style="width: 100px"> | This page will display a list of the user's existing tasks. |

| Completed Tasks | <img src="doc/completed-tasks-mockup.png" style="width: 100px"> | This page will allow the user to return to completed tasks for reference and tracking purposes. |

Phase 2: Updating our app to include data from a hard-coded database and other mockup pages. These pages utilize User, Task, and Item databases that have been hard-coded with sample data.

| Items Page with Data | <img src="doc/itemspagewithdata.png" style="width: 100px"> | Items page implemented with sample data. |

| Sign-up Page (Mockup) | <img src="doc/onboarding.png" style="width: 100px"> | New users can register through the sign-in page. |

| Individual Tasks Page | <img src="doc/individual-task.png" style="width: 100px"> | Information for each task can be viewed independently. |

| --- |

Phase 3: Implementing Riverpod methods for databases and continuing to add to UI.

| Sign-up Page | <img src="doc/sign_up.png" style="width: 100px"> | The sign-up page adds a new user to the existing database of users. |

| Check-in | <img src="doc/check_in.png" style="width: 100px"> | Page displaying check-in information accessed through Riverpod providers. |

| All Tasks | <img src="doc/all_tasks.png" style="width: 100px"> | Page displaying all tasks for each user accessed through Riverpod providers. |

| Add Task | <img src="doc/add_task.png" style="width: 100px"> | Adds a new task to the existing database of tasks. |

| Choose Avatar | <img src="doc/choose_appearance.png" style="width: 100px"> | Sets or changes the Dad avatar. |
