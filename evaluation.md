## User Goals
* Users can effectively plan for maintenance of their items.
* Users feels that sharing tasks with their friends and family helps minimize the workload.

## Scenarios
In order to test the intuitiveness of our app, we would like for users to naturally find the requested functionalities. 

* **Scenario 1:**
  * _Prompt:_ Pretend that you need to change your air conditioner's filter. Please navigate to the add task page and create a task for this. You would like to do this by noon tomorrow and you can buy a filter at any store for around $20.
  * _Success:_ The user created an associated task and will be ready to go to the store to buy a new filter tomorrow.

* **Scenario 2:**
  * _Prompt:_ You just checked the store and they did not have filters in stock. You could either check back with them in a week or choose a different location to visit some other day. Whichever you decide, please make the appropriate edits to the task you created earlier.
  * _Success:_ The user was able to edit the associated task and sees the changes made.

* **Scenario 3:**
  * _Prompt:_ Today is when you are supposed to buy the filter, so you go to the store and pick it up. When you get home, your tire starts losing air because of a nail on the driveway. You do not have the means to replace it, but your friend John Doe can help. Please make a task for this, and be sure to include that your friend John Doe will be able to help you by the end of the week.
  * _Success:_ The user creates the requested task and is able to add their friend to the task.

* **Scenario 4:**
  * _Prompt:_ Your sister Jane Roe finished college and is moving back in with you and the family. She is also a PocketDad user and wants to be added to the house so she can see what needs to be done. You can either add her to certain tasks, or add her to the house item.
  * _Success:_ The user edited some tasks to include their sister, or they edited the house item to include their sister.
