## User Goals
* Users can effectively plan for maintenance of their items.
* Users feel that the ability to share task lists with their friends and family helps with workload distribution.
* Users feel a sense of comfort and companionship from knowing they have a resource to help them handle unfamiliar tasks.


## Scenarios
In order to test the intuitiveness of our app, we would like for users to naturally find the requested functionalities. 

* **Scenario 1:**
  * _Prompt:_ Pretend that you need to change your air conditioner's filter. Please navigate to the add task page and create a task for this. You would like to do this by noon tomorrow and you can buy a filter at any store for around $20.
  * _Success:_ The user created an associated task and will be ready to go to the store to buy a new filter tomorrow.

* **Scenario 2:**
  * _Prompt:_ Today is when you are supposed to buy the filter, so you go to the store and pick it up. When you get home, your tire starts losing air because of a nail on the driveway. You do not have the means to replace it, but your friend John Doe can help. Please make a task for this, and be sure to include that your friend John Doe will be able to help you by the end of the week.
  * _Success:_ The user creates the requested task and is able to add their friend to the task.
